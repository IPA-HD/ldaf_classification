# Self-Certifying Classification by Linearized Deep Assignment

This repository contains pytorch code for training and testing self-certifying classifiers. It implements linearized deep assignment flows operating on features extracted by [a variant](https://github.com/kuangliu/pytorch-cifar) of ResNet18.

For details on implemented methods, please consult the corresponding paper [on ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11162).

The code was developed by the [IPA](https://ipa.math.uni-heidelberg.de) group at Heidelberg University.
